## Film Query Project

This is a project that uses Java to read from a database.

When the program is run, the user is prompted with a menu on how they would like to search for a film.

Option 1 allows the user to search films based on the ID number of the film. When a film is returned, it is displayed with title, description, release year, rating, language, and a list of actors in the film.

Option 2 allows the user to search films using keywords.
When a user searches keywords, all films containing the keywords in either the name or the description are displayed, in the same fashion as Option 1.

For both options, if no film is found then the users sees a message saying as such.

The user can continue searches until they choose to exit the program.
